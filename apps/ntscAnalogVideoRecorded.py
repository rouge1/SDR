# US television is *negative* modulation: the sync tip is peak carrier and

# and peak white at 12.5%.
#
# The composite signal arrives with sync at 0.0 and white at 1.0, so
# carrier = 1 - 0.875*v maps the three straight onto each other - and lands
# blanking on 0.75 by itself, which is the check that the two scales agree.

#: Aural carrier amplitude against peak visual. FCC 73.682 sets aural power
#: at 10% of peak visual power, which is this in voltage. It was 0.8 here -

# The filter is a low pass at 2.475 MHz, and it does its work in the frame
# where the carrier sits at -1.725: it then passes 0.75 MHz below the
# carrier and 4.2 MHz above, which is the vestigial sideband and the full
