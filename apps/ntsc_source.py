"""Composite NTSC baseband, live, from whatever you point it at.

``ntsc_encode`` turns one frame into one frame's worth of composite video.
This turns a *stream* of frames into a continuous signal a flowgraph can
transmit, and answers the question of what video format this project takes:
**whatever ffmpeg reads**. There is no bespoke format to convert to.

Three things can feed it:

- a **video file** - mp4, mkv, avi, webm, anything ffmpeg decodes - scaled
  to 640x480 and letterboxed if it is not 4:3, looping forever;
- a **still frame**, which is what the instructor's ``.dat`` captures are;
- a **built-in colour-bar pattern**, so the app works with no media at all.

The ``.dat`` files do not come through here. They are already composite
video, sampled at 18 MS/s, so they are played by a plain file source and
resampled - see ``dat_resample_ratio``.

**Frames are encoded on their own thread.** Encoding a frame takes about
20 ms, and a GNU Radio work() call at 10 MS/s covers well under a
millisecond, so encoding inside work() would stall the radio for 20 ms
every 33 ms and underrun it. A small queue between the two is what keeps
the output continuous, and it paces the encoder for free: the queue fills,
the producer blocks, and frames are pulled at exactly the rate the radio
consumes them.

AUDIO_RATE = 48000

#: Conditioning applied to a clip's sound before it modulates the aural
#: carrier, which is the same shape of processing every real station runs.
#:
#: The clips are loudness-normalised to -24 LKFS (ATSC A/85), which is
#: deliberately quiet: measured across all fourteen, peaks ran 0.30 to 1.11
#: and rms 0.038 to 0.088. Fed straight to a modulator whose full deviation
#: is |1.0|, the quietest of them would have swung +-7.5 kHz of the +-25 kHz
#: System M allows - 10 dB down, and it would have been reported as the sound
#: being too quiet rather than as a level fault.
#:
#: A fixed gain alone cannot fix it, because the *loudness* is uniform and
#: the crest factor is not: 8 dB puts speech where it belongs and clips the
#: two music-heavy Blender films on 0.17% of their samples. Compressing
#: first and then lifting gives rms 0.091-0.210 and peaks 0.64-1.54 across
#: the whole set, with the worst clip needing the rail on 0.0017% of samples
#: - one in sixty thousand. Both numbers are measured, not guessed.
#:
#: ffmpeg's own `loudnorm` would be the obvious tool and is the wrong one

#: comes from a *separate* ffmpeg on the same file, that delay would land

        This waited a tenth of a second for a frame before giving up, which
        turned a late frame into a *silent transmitter*: nothing came out of
        the block, so nothing reached the radio, and off air the carrier was
        simply absent for up to 100 ms at a time. Measured on the VSG60 with
        a real clip, before the encoder was given more threads: 74 gaps in
        three seconds, the longest 18.6 ms, 25% of the air time missing -
        and the picture still decoded, so only a look at the envelope showed
        it at all. The same trap as the HackRF ATSC case in CLAUDE.md.

        So the wait is two milliseconds, long enough to catch a frame that
        is about to arrive and far too short to take the transmitter off
        air, and what fills the gap is the *previous* frame rather than
        blanking. A frozen picture keeps sync pulses and colour burst
        coming; blanking is a level, and a receiver loses lock on it.
