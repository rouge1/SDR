      changes width - "Power Level: 5%" to "Power Level: 100%" moved it.

    - **Short dialogs spread their contents out.** A forced 400 px minimum
      height left the receivers half empty, and a ``QVBoxLayout`` hands the

    Call it first thing in the window's ``__init__``, before any widget

    there. Two things depend on that timing.

    - **The plots' axis titles take the application font as it is when the
      plot is built**, and keep it. GNU Radio sets their size as a font of
      their own, copied from the application's, and Qt has no way to reach
      a Qwt title from Python afterwards. So the face is made the
      application's here, before any plot exists; set after, the axis
      titles stayed in the system face while everything round them was
      Barlow. It is set on the application rather than in the stylesheet
      because a stylesheet font beats ``setFont()``, and the receivers set
      fonts that mean something - monospace RadioText, a large lock status.
    - **The traces are recoloured when the window is first shown.** Every
      app sets its traces in GNU Radio's colours for a white canvas, black
      commonest, which on the well would be invisible. The stylesheet sets
      them again through the plots' own ``line_color`` properties, and a
      stylesheet's properties are applied when a widget is polished - on
      show, after the app's own ``set_line_color`` calls.

    It is paint only: every control and every plot is the app's own.

    **The stylesheet made GNU Radio's sliders follow the mouse.** A Qt
    stylesheet with hover rules turns on mouse tracking, so a slider hears
    every movement of the pointer across it, button or not - measured, off
    with no stylesheet and on with the flowgraph one. GNU Radio's
    ``RangeWidget`` slider has its own ``mouseMoveEvent``, which jumps to
    wherever the pointer is without asking whether a button is down. So
    passing the mouse over a power slider set the power: 50 % to 89 % on
    the way across. Every window with a ``RangeWidget`` slider did it.

    **The wheel was the same thing by another route.** Most windows scroll
    on a laptop, and a scroll that passed over a slider, a spin box or a
    combo box moved that instead - power, frequency, deviation - and a spin
    box took focus from the wheel alone.

    So, on every slider, spin box and combo box in the window, a mouse
    move with no button down is dropped; a wheel turn over one that has
    not been clicked goes on to the scroll area behind it; and the wheel no
    longer gives focus. Clicking gives it, and dragging, typing and the
    wheel then work as they always did. The scroll bars are left alone:
    scrolling is what the wheel is for. Installed on the window by
