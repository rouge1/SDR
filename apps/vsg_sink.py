"""GNU Radio sink block for the Signal Hound VSG60 vector signal generator.

The VSG60 has no SoapySDR module and no native GNU Radio block, so this
wraps the vendor C API (``libvsg_api.so``) with ctypes and exposes it as a
``gr.sync_block``.

The block deliberately mirrors the setter names used by ``uhd.usrp_sink`` and
``soapy.sink`` so it drops into the existing ``if radio_type == ...`` branches
in the app modules without special-casing every call site.

Hardware limits (measured on firmware 6, API 1.0.3):
    frequency    30 MHz .. 6 GHz
    sample rate  12.5 kS/s .. 50 MS/s
    level        -120 .. +10 dBm   (calibrated absolute output power)
