"""Composite video decoder, NTSC or PAL - the other half of ``ntsc_encode``.

Takes composite baseband samples and gives back pictures: finds sync, locks
the line and field structure, samples the active line into pixels, and
demodulates chroma against the colour burst.

It exists to *check* the encoder, the way ``rds_core`` checks ``rds_encode``.
``scripts/test_ntsc_loopback.py`` and ``scripts/test_pal_loopback.py`` run
frames through both and compare the picture that comes back with the one
that went in, so a timing or phase mistake shows up as a number rather than
as "the TV looked wrong". The receivers use it off the air too.

Free of GNU Radio and Qt, so it also runs against a recorded capture.

Three things worth knowing before changing it:

**Sync is found by pulse width, not by level.** Equalizing pulses, line
sync and the field-sync serrations all sit at exactly the same level, so a
threshold crossing says nothing about which is which. How long the signal
stays down is what separates the start of a field from the start of a line.

**Colour is measured against the burst, never against the sample clock.**
The burst is a few cycles of the subcarrier at a known phase, sent on every
line for exactly this purpose: it says where the subcarrier's zero crossing
is *on this line*, which is the only way to know what the chroma phase on
that line means. Decoding against a locally generated subcarrier instead
gets the hue wrong by however much the sampling origin happened to differ.

**PAL's burst says two things at once.** It sits 45 degrees either side of
the -U axis, the side swapping every line with the V switch. Averaged over
neighbouring lines the swing cancels and leaves the reference axis; each
line's own burst, measured against that, says which way its V was sent.
