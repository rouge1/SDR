"""Run one app module on its own, owning the Qt event loop.

An app's ``main()`` ends with::

    if app.instance():
        return tb
    else:
        return app.exec_()

which is the launcher contract in CLAUDE.md - the launcher already owns a
QApplication and its loop, so ``main()`` hands back the top block rather
than blocking. The catch is that ``app.instance()`` is truthy the moment a
QApplication exists, so a module run directly takes that same branch: it
builds the flowgraph, shows the window, returns, and the window never gets
an event loop at all.

This is the piece the launcher supplies, for running one app without
it - on a bench machine over ssh, say, or from a test. It owns the
QApplication, calls ``main()`` exactly as ``launch_application`` does, and
runs the loop itself::

    python apps/_run.py amSineGenerator
    python apps/_run.py amSineGenerator --config /tmp/values.json

Without ``--config`` the flowgraph puts up the app's own ``ConfigDialog``,
so this is the same experience as clicking the tile in the grid. With
one, the dialog is skipped and the values are used as they stand. With
no screen - over ssh - set ``QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen``: the window is
drawn into nothing, and the flowgraph and the radio run as normal.

SIGTERM or SIGINT - ``timeout``, ``kill``, Ctrl+C - stops the flowgraph
and ends the process, and if that stop is stuck, the process ends anyway
:data:`STOP_GRACE_S` later. Nothing is saved, as it would be had the
window been closed. See devnotes/ui.md for why this needs doing here.

Run it with the ``gnu`` environment's Python - it imports GNU Radio
through the app module.
