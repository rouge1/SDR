"""A transport stream for the ATSC transmitter, from any video ffmpeg reads.

The transmitter consumes an MPEG-2 transport stream at exactly 19,392,658
bit/s, and it used to take nothing else: it listed the ``.ts`` files in the
media folder and played one. Every clip exists as a ``.ts`` as well as a
``.mp4`` (see ``media/VIDEO-CREDITS.txt``), so on this machine the list
looked complete. TVAdemo, the machine that transmits, was sent the fourteen
``.mp4`` files and not the 3.5 GB of ``.ts`` twins, and its picker offered
the test pattern and nothing else.

So **a clip with no ``.ts`` is encoded into one as it plays**, by ffmpeg,
with the settings the ``.ts`` files were made with, into a pipe the
flowgraph reads. That is cheap: on the Ford clip, the busiest in the folder,
it ran at 21x real time on the 8-core bench and 31x on TVAdemo, and what
came through the pipe was the mux rate to 0.01% in whole 188-byte packets.
The radio paces it - ffmpeg blocks when the pipe is full - so nothing needs
a clock of its own.

**A clip that has its ``.ts`` still plays that file directly.** It costs no
processor, and it is the file that was checked through the loopback.

**And there are colour bars with no file at all** (:data:`COLOUR_BARS`),
as the NTSC and FM video transmitters have, so the app transmits from an
empty media folder. The Windows laptop's holds only MP3s, and the transmitter
there had nothing it could send. ffmpeg makes the bars as well, from nothing,
at 55x real time here.
