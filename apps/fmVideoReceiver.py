# FM Video Receiver - the other end of ``fmVideoXmitter``, and the other
# side of its tile. It discriminates the carrier, takes the pre-emphasis
# back out, decodes the composite into pictures and demodulates the sound
# off the subcarriers riding above them.
#
# It is also a measuring instrument, on purpose. The FPV profile's video
# deviation and its "no pre-emphasis" are this project's guesses - neither
# RichWave datasheet gives either - so a receiver pointed at a real FPV
# transmitter has to be able to say what that transmitter actually does,
# rather than assume the guesses and show a picture that is subtly wrong.
# Everything under "Measured" is read off the signal against levels the
# television standard fixes, so none of it needs a test pattern or any
# knowledge of what is being televised.

    Output 0 is composite at the format's own video rate, sync tip near 0

    1 is the discriminated baseband at the radio's rate, *before*
    de-emphasis: the sound subcarriers ride up there, and so does everything
    worth measuring.

    **Discriminating is the whole of it.** A constant-envelope signal
    carries all of its information in the phase, so there is no carrier to
    recover and no gain control to settle - which is most of why FM video
    was the easy one to receive. What follows is only undoing what the
    transmitter did, in reverse order: the sampled modulator's own
    over-swing, then the pre-emphasis, then the band.

    **Neither a wrong deviation nor a mistuned carrier costs the picture,
    and it is worth knowing why.** ``CompositeDecoder`` reads sync tip and
    blanking off the signal and scales everything by the step between them,
    so a deviation setting that is out by a factor simply rescales what it
    is handed, and a carrier offset moves a level it measures rather than
    assumes. That is what makes this usable against a transmitter whose
    numbers nobody knows: get those two wrong and the picture still comes
    up, and the readout says by how much. Pre-emphasis is the one that does
    not forgive - the wrong curve tilts the picture's frequency response,
    which shows as wrong colour rather than as a wrong setting.
