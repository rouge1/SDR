# The desktop launcher, its dialogs and its windows

One of the notes in `devnotes/`. What applies everywhere, and which
file covers what, is in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## The launcher grid, and tiles that flip

Every tile is declared in `APP_TILES` at the top of `RFbenchToolkit.py`
as `(row, column, [face, ...])`, where a face is
`(label, module, icon, direction)` and direction is `'tx'` or `'rx'`.
A tile with more than one face is a **flip tile**: a badge in its corner
turns it over, and the icon and the caption both change with it. That is
how the two ends of one standard share a square - the ATSC, NTSC and
FM + RDS transmitters and their receivers - instead of sitting apart as
though they were unrelated apps. All three video standards
now have both ends on one tile, FM video included.

**The grid follows the radio.** `RADIO_DIRECTIONS` says which way each of
the four can go, and `apply_radio_directions()` runs on startup and again
every time Settings closes:

| Radio | What the grid does |
|-------|--------------------|
| HackRF One, Ettus USRP | both directions - the two pairs stay flippable |
| Signal Hound VSG60 | every tile turns to transmit; badges disappear |
| Signal Hound BB60D | every tile turns to receive; the ten transmit-only tiles dim out |

- **Only a tile that has something to say has a tooltip.** A usable
  tile's would only repeat the name printed on it, so it has none; the
  user found them clutter on 2026-09-19. The flip
  badge keeps its "Flip to …", because a glyph does not say what it does,
  and a screen reader still gets each tile's name - the tile is a button
  with no text of its own, so it is set as its accessible name.
- **A dimmed tile says why.** Its tooltip names the direction it needs and
  the radio that cannot do it ("AM Sine Generator needs a radio that can
  transmit. The Signal Hound BB60D cannot."). A greyed square that explains
  itself beats an app that opens and then fails on a device it was never
  going to be able to use. `launch_application` still checks, as a
  backstop, but reads the direction off `APP_TILES` rather than keeping a
  second list in step with it.
- **A turn the radio forces is not remembered.** `tile_faces` records what
  the *user* chose with the badge; capability turns pass `remember=False`.
  So flip ATSC to receive on a HackRF, switch to the VSG and watch it turn
  to transmit, switch back - and it returns to receive. Saving the forced
  turn instead would quietly destroy the preference every time the radio
  changed.
- **Dimming is painted, not an effect.** The caption already carries a
  `QGraphicsOpacityEffect` for the fade, and effects do not nest
  predictably, so `_draw` sets the painter's opacity instead.

- **The turn is drawn, not faked with a swap.** `FlipTile` animates a
  `flip_phase` property from 0 to 1 and squeezes the icon horizontally by
  `cos` of it, through zero width and back out, changing face at the moment
  it is edge on - which is exactly when none of it is visible. The caption
  fades on the same curve rather than being squeezed, because squeezed text
  reads as a rendering fault.
- **The property is `flip_phase`, not `flip`.** `flip()` is the method that
  starts a turn; naming the `pyqtProperty` the same thing replaces the
  method with the property object and the badge stops working.
- **Every face is cropped to the same 4:3 box**, so two icons with
  different aspect ratios cannot clip one another or shove the caption
  around mid-turn. The caption is given the height of the longest name on
  the grid, for the same reason: otherwise one long name makes its own
  tile taller than the rest of its row.
- **Which side is up lives in `window_settings.json`** under `tile_faces`,
  keyed by the tile's first module name, so a tile left showing the
  receiver is still showing it next time.
- **The single-face path is the same code.** `create_app_button` is kept as
  a one-face call into `create_tile`, so nothing else had to change.

## Where the windows come back

Three windows remember where they were left, and all three keep it the same
way: plain `x`, `y`, `width`, `height` in JSON, applied size-first, and only
when the saved position would land somewhere still reachable
(`geometry_is_reachable` in `apps/utils.py`, which looks across every
screen rather than just the primary one).

**The launcher and every flowgraph window also remember being
maximized**, as `"maximized": true` beside the other four - which then hold
the *normal* geometry (`normal_geometry` in `apps/utils.py`, from Qt's
`normalGeometry()`), so un-maximizing after a restart gives back the size
the window had. Saved as `pos()` and `size()` while maximized, as the
launcher once did, they held the whole screen instead. A config saved
before the flag existed has no `maximized` and comes back normal. Three
things about it:

- **On GNOME a window cannot be maximized before it is on screen.** Set on
  the hidden window, the state never reaches the window manager: Qt reports
  the window maximized, GNOME maps it at its normal size, and a moment later
  Qt agrees with GNOME. Qt's own `showMaximized()` fails the same way,
  measured. So `load_window_position` places the launcher at its normal
  geometry and `showEvent` asks for maximized once it is up - which costs a
  glimpse of the normal-sized window first. The same path serves single
  mode, where the launcher is hidden while an app runs and shown again.
- **"Once it is up" means exposed, not shown** - `when_exposed` in
  `apps/utils.py`. `show()` only asks for a window, and GNOME puts it up,
  title bar and all, a little later. A flowgraph window is restored after
  `main()` has shown it, and done straight away that went wrong twice.
  Until the frame is on, Qt does not know how thick it is, so `move()` put
  the *inside* of the window where the frame's corner was meant to go:
  37 px higher every time it was opened. And a maximize asked for before
  the window is mapped goes out as a property GNOME reads only at map
  time, so it was lost on one run and kept on the next. Both the flowgraph
  restore and the launcher's maximize now wait for Qt to report the window
  exposed (3 s at most, for a window that never is). Verified through the
  window manager on GNOME, three runs of each: a flowgraph window
  maximized by the WM's own `_NET_WM_STATE` request, saved, reopened
  maximized, un-maximized to exactly 1000x700 at (200, 150), and reopened
  there, with no drift.
- **On Windows a flowgraph window came back maximized, but not by this
  code; the launcher's own has not been tried.** Nothing started over SSH
  can show it: the laptop runs those in session 0, where Windows reports
  no window as visible, and Qt only asks Windows to maximize a window it
  believes is visible - so nothing there can be maximized from inside,
  whatever the code does. It was checked by hand on the laptop's own
  desktop instead, on 2026-09-18: a flowgraph window left maximized came
  back maximized. It was found later the same day that the dialog's OK
  had been deleting the saved position before the window could read it
  (see [what the window's own controls were left
  at](#what-the-windows-own-controls-were-left-at)), so what brought it
  back was the app's own `QSettings` `restoreGeometry`, which works there
  because that screen never changes size. Through the launcher, on
  Windows, the JSON path has not been looked at since the fix. The
  launcher's own window sends the same request - the `ShowWindow` a click on the
  maximize button makes - but nobody has looked. On GNOME both are
  verified through the window manager rather than through Qt: the
  launcher maximized, closed, reopened maximized, restored to exactly the
  geometry it had, and through single mode's hide and show, with no
  drift. The flowgraph window's check there called the save and restore
  directly, which is why it did not catch the dialog.

| Window | Where it is kept |
|--------|------------------|
| The launcher | `window_position` in `config/window_settings.json` |
| An app's config dialog | `dialog_position` in `config/<module>_config.json` |
| An app's flowgraph window | `flowgraph_position`, in that same per-app file, with `maximized` |

**The flowgraph's was the one that did not work, and it looked like it was
never being saved.** Every app already calls Qt's own
`saveGeometry`/`restoreGeometry` against `QSettings("GNU Radio", <app>)`,
and the *saving* half works - the stored blobs hold real geometries, 1782
x1161 at (215, 258) and so on. Two things stopped them coming back:

- **Qt 5 refuses to restore at all when the screen has changed size.**
  `restoreGeometry` compares the screen width the blob was saved on against
  the current one and returns false, restoring nothing, if they differ by
  more than a quarter. The blobs here were written on screens 2880 and 3840
  wide - a laptop with an external monitor does that every time it is
  plugged in - so 3840/2880 = 1.33 tripped it.
- **It runs before the window exists.** Each app calls it at the top of its
  `__init__`, which is the GRC-generated idiom, and then builds every
  control, box and plot afterwards. The layout can overrule the restored
  size once the widgets are in.

So the geometry is applied *after* `main()` has shown the window - and
after the window manager has put it up, see above - by whichever started
it: `RFbenchToolkit.py` for the grid, or `apps/_run.py` for an app [run on
its own](#running-one-app-without-the-launcher). It is saved from the
close-event wrapper the launcher already installs, read before the app's
own `closeEvent` stops the flowgraph. Each app keeps its `QSettings`
calls, which is what an app run directly still uses.
`scripts/test_flowgraph_windows.py` checks the round trip, maximized and
not, into a throwaway folder - and that a dialog's OK leaves the saved
position alone, which for the first day it did not.

The saved size is clamped to the current screen but the position is not:
a window deliberately parked against an edge, or on a second monitor,
should come back there.

**Where each of them goes the first time, before anything is saved:**

- The launcher **works out its own size** (`natural_size`): wide enough
  for the widest bank's five tiles in one row at `PREFERRED_TILE`, 185 px,
  and exactly tall enough for every bank - which on this machine is
  **997x826**, centred on the primary screen at (941, 397) on a 2880x1620
  display. The width is arithmetic; the height is *measured*, by laying
  the grid out at that width and asking the column how tall it came out,
  because it depends on how tall the machine sets a line of text. A size
  written down by hand, 1000x820, fitted here by 2 px and would have
  scrolled on any machine whose fonts run a pixel taller; measured, it is
  right wherever it runs - make the type a pixel taller and it picks 835,
  four pixels and the captions wrap and it picks 928, with nothing to
  scroll and 2 px less scrolling every time. It is then clamped to the
  screen's *available* geometry, so a 1366x768 laptop, which cannot show
  all three banks, gets as much as fits and a scroll bar rather than a
  window partly under the panel. Before any of this there was no default
  at all: with no `window_position` it fell back to its 800x600
  *minimum*, which wrapped the first bank onto two rows on a screen with
  room to spare.
- A config dialog opens **in the middle of the launcher**, which is where
  the eye already is, having just clicked a tile. It used to be the
  launcher's top-left corner plus fifty pixels, which on a wide window put
  it well off to one side of what was clicked. `centre_on` in
  `apps/utils.py` does it, and has to `adjustSize()` first: the dialog has
  not been shown yet, so its size must be asked for rather than read.
  It clamps into the screen the launcher is on, because a launcher parked
  against an edge would otherwise centre part of the dialog off it -
  measured, a launcher at (2600, 1300) on a 2880x1620 screen wants a
  centre of (3099, 1739) and the dialog is pulled back to (2497, 1111).
- The settings dialog needs none of this: it is built with `parent=self`,
  so Qt centres it on the launcher already. The config dialogs cannot be,
  because each app's `ConfigDialog()` takes no parent - which is why Qt
  would otherwise drop them in the middle of the *screen*, nowhere near
  the launcher on a wide desktop.

### What the window's own controls were left at

**The power and the centre frequency set in a flowgraph window are kept
too** - gain, on a receiver - so the dialog opens next time on what the
window was left at. Before, a change made in the window lasted only as
long as the window: the dialog opened on its own last value, and pressing
OK put that back on the air. They go into the same per-app file, under the
keys the dialog already reads:

| Apps | Power key | Frequency key | Window attributes |
|------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| The other eleven transmitters | `power_level` | `center_freq` | `rfPwr`, and `cf` or `centerFreq` - and on FM video, `deviation_mhz` from `deviation_mhz` too |
| FM + RDS Transmitter | `power_percent` | `frequency_mhz` | `power_percent`, `freq_mhz` |
| RDS Receiver | `gain_percent` | `frequency_mhz` | `gain_percent`, `freq_mhz` |
| The three video receivers | `gain_percent` | `center_mhz` | `gain_percent`, `center_mhz` |

Each flowgraph class names what it keeps in `SAVED_SETTINGS`, from that
key to the attribute its setter keeps current, and `save_flowgraph_settings`
in `apps/utils.py` writes them from the same close hook as the geometry, in
both launchers. **Only what was changed in the window is written**: each
launcher takes `flowgraph_settings` as the window opens and passes it as
`since`, so a control nobody touched is left as the dialog saved it - and
two windows of one app open at once, in multi mode, cannot put back each
other's unchanged values. To keep another control, add it to that dict.
The dialog must read the key and the setter must update the attribute, or
it saves the value the window started with.

**A saved value has to fit the dialog control that reads it back**, and
for frequency most of them did not:

- **A window's counter takes two more decimals than its step.** GNU
  Radio's `Range` sets its counter's precision that way, and a typed value
  is not snapped to the step. So a window stepping in 0.01 MHz takes
  433.9234, one stepping in 0.1 takes 533.012, and the NTSC transmitter's,
  stepping in 0.001, takes 10 Hz. `FrequencyChooser` held 0.1 MHz; it now
  holds `FREQ_DECIMALS`, five, and its box shows only the digits a value
  needs - 533.0, 433.92 - so the television dialogs look as they did.
- **Seven dialogs chose frequency with a whole-MHz `QSlider`** - ASK, FSK,
  PSK, AM Sine, AM Audio, FM Audio and PPM-OOK - while their windows tune
  in 0.01. They use `FrequencyChooser` now, as the ATSC, NTSC and FM video
  dialogs already did. That is a looks change the user chose on
  2026-09-18, over rounding what the window saved to what the slider
  could show.
- **`QSlider.setValue` raises on a float, and `load_config`'s bare
  `except` then drops every setting after it** - power included, since it
  is loaded after frequency. The subcarrier dialog kept its whole-MHz
  slider, because its window steps in whole megahertz, but it loads the
  frequency through `int(round(...))` all the same.

**Everything that writes an app's file merges into it**, through
`update_app_config` in `apps/utils.py`. Three things share each file and
none of them owns it: the dialog writes its settings, the launcher the
dialog's position, the window its geometry and its controls. Every
dialog's `save_config` used to write the whole file from its own dict, so
OK deleted `flowgraph_position` a moment before the window came up to
read it. This was found on 2026-09-18 while adding the power saving: the
JSON restore described above had never once run through either launcher.
A dialog's `load_config` defaults whatever the file lacks, so a key left
over from an older version does no harm.

`scripts/test_flowgraph_windows.py` sets each window's own controls to a
new value in their finest digit - 301.0007 on a 0.01 window - and saves
them the way the launchers do. Only what it changed may be in the file,
a fresh dialog must open on exactly those values, and its OK must keep
the window's position. It was also driven through
`RFbenchToolkit.launch_application` and `apps/_run.py` themselves, in a
copy of the repo with its own `config/`. That covered a whole-MHz dialog
turned `FrequencyChooser`, the two RDS apps, a video receiver and three
video transmitters. Each opened on the power and frequency its window
closed at, two opens running, and a window closed untouched left another
save of the frequency alone.

## How every dialog gets laid out

Each of the fifteen `ConfigDialog`s is assembled by hand out of
`QVBoxLayout` and `QHBoxLayout`, and they were all crooked in the same
ways - which is why `apply_dark_theme` now ends by calling `tidy_dialog`
rather than fifteen dialogs each being fixed on their own. Four faults, all
of them visible in a screenshot, all measured across all fifteen:

- **The label in a row sat four or five pixels below the control beside
  it.** The stylesheet gave every `QLabel` a `margin-top: 10px`, to space a
  caption off whatever was above it. Inside a row that margin pushes the
  *text* down within the label's own rectangle while the spin box or slider
  beside it stays centred, so the box reads as sitting high - which is
  exactly how it was reported ("the 177 box is higher than the text next to
  it"). The margin is gone; vertical space comes from layout spacing, which
  is what layout spacing is for, and a caption gets its extra room above
  through `setContentsMargins` on the caption alone.
- **The controls started at a different x in every row**, because each one
  began wherever its label's text happened to end - four different
  positions in one dialog. Every label that leads a row is given the width
  of the widest of them. It has to be `QSizePolicy.Fixed` as well as a
  minimum width: a label is `Preferred` by default, so in a row with a spin
  box - which is `Expanding` - the two share the slack and that row's
  control still starts 26 px right of every other.
- **A nested row was indented.** Sub-layouts and the plain `QWidget`
  containers that exist only to carry a `QGraphicsOpacityEffect` keep their
  own default 9 px margins, so "Sine Frequency" sat ten pixels right of
  every other label in the same dialog.
- **Short dialogs spread their contents out.** A forced 400 px minimum
  height left the receiver dialogs half empty, and a `QVBoxLayout` hands
  the slack to whatever can grow - which is the labels, so the gaps came
  out uneven. There is no minimum height now, and a stretch before the
  button box collects any slack in one place.

Two things about doing it centrally:

- **A group box is entered for its nested layouts but not for its rows.**
  Its contents are indented from the dialog's column by the frame, so
  pulling its rows into that column would push them back out of the box.
  The RDS box in the FM + RDS transmitter is the one that has both.
- **Anything a stylesheet touches stops drawing its own sub-controls.**
  Styling `QAbstractSpinBox` so it matches the combo boxes - and without
  that it falls through to the plain `QWidget` rule and comes out as a flat
  dark box - leaves the up and down buttons as empty rectangles. Qt's CSS
  subset will not draw a triangle out of borders either; it renders the
  four borders as a rectangle. So they are images - `icons/spin-up.png`,
  `icons/spin-down.png`, which the combo boxes use for their own arrow
  too, and `icons/check.png` for a ticked box - referenced through
  `icon_url()` by absolute path: a stylesheet resolves `url()` against the
  process's working directory, and forward slashes are required on Windows
  because a backslash is an escape to the stylesheet parser.

```sh
python scripts/test_dialog_layout.py                  # all 15, all 4 radios
python scripts/test_dialog_layout.py --radio vsg
python scripts/test_dialog_layout.py --save /tmp/shots
```

opens every dialog on Qt's offscreen platform - no radio, no display - and
measures the four things above, plus that no combo box lists the same entry
twice and that nothing is bigger than the 1366x768 laptop. Sixty dialogs in
about twenty seconds. It patches `read_settings` rather than the settings
file, because a test must never write into the user's own configuration.

## Testing the launcher end to end

The `scripts/test_*.py` in these notes all bypass the GUI. `scripts/test_launcher_gui.py`
covers what they cannot - that `linux/start_app.sh` starts, that a button press
reaches `launch_application`, that the dialog accepts, that the flowgraph
window appears, and that closing it brings the launcher back - by driving real
X input through xdotool (`apt install xdotool`):

```sh
python scripts/test_launcher_gui.py "FM + RDS Receiver"
python scripts/test_launcher_gui.py "FM + RDS Transmitter" --hold 30
python scripts/test_launcher_gui.py "ATSC Video Receiver"
```

`scripts/test_app_close.py` checks the last of those for every app at once,
with no radio, no display and no launcher to close first. It calls each
app's real `main()` the way `launch_application` does, with a stand-in
window for the flowgraph, closes the window, and requires the launcher to be
visible again with its event loop still running. The ATSC transmitter failed
it (see [its notes](atsc.md#atsc-transmitter)); nothing else did.

- **Close any running launcher first.** A launcher process keeps a USB handle
  on the HackRF - `/proc/<pid>/fd` shows `/dev/bus/usb/...` - even while it is
  only *sitting on a config dialog*. `SoapySDR.Device.enumerate` then returns
  zero devices and the app under test fails with `Device::make() no match`,
  which surfaces as a modal error box that nothing dismisses, so an automated
  run just hangs. The script refuses to start if it finds one.
- **Button coordinates are found, not computed.** High-DPI scaling moves the
  grid, so `button_grid()` locates the icons as bright blobs in a screenshot
  and `registered_apps()` reads the launcher's own `APP_TILES` table. A
  button that moves takes the click with it.
- **That table is parsed with `ast`, not a regex and not an import.** A flip
  tile's faces are a nested list, which is the shape a regex reads wrongly;
  and importing the launcher opens a window, when the whole point is to
  drive the one `linux/start_app.sh` starts. `RADIO_DIRECTIONS` comes out the
  same way, so the test knows which apps the selected radio can run and
  says so up front rather than failing later like a broken button.
- **A blob's position in its row is not its grid column.** Row 2 ends at
  column 3 now that the RDS receiver has moved onto the transmitter's tile,
  and screenshot blobs come back packed left to right knowing nothing about
  gaps. `registered_apps()` works out each tile's position among the tiles
  its row actually has.
- **An app on the back of a flip tile is reached through the saved
  setting**, not by clicking the badge: `tile_showing()` writes the same
  `tile_faces` entry the badge writes, so the launcher comes up already
  showing the app under test, and puts it back afterwards. Clicking the
  badge would test the animation rather than the app, and would mean
  finding a 32-pixel circle in a screenshot. Only that one key is restored,
  because the launcher saves its window position into the same file while
  the test runs.
- Screenshots are grabbed with Qt rather than scrot/import/maim, none of which
  are guaranteed present, while PyQt5 is already a hard dependency.
- `Return` activates the dialog's default button, which is OK - cheaper than
  hunting for its pixels. Window close buttons sit at `(X + WIDTH - 33,
  Y + 30)` from the frame geometry xdotool reports, *not* at its corner.

## Running one app without the launcher

`apps/_run.py` runs one app on its own, with no grid - on a bench machine
over ssh, say, or from a test, one machine transmitting and another
receiving:

```sh
python apps/_run.py amSineGenerator                        # its own dialog first
python apps/_run.py amSineGenerator --config values.json   # no dialog
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen timeout -k 5 120 \
    python apps/_run.py amSineGenerator --config values.json   # headless, 2 min
```

`--config` holds what the app's dialog would return, and skips the
dialog. `_run.py` alone does not make an app headless: it still builds
its window, and with no screen - over ssh - `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`
draws that window into nothing while the flowgraph and the radio run as
normal.

It was written for a browser front end, `web/server.py`, which started
each app as a process of its own. That front end was removed on
2026-09-19 (see [one design for every
window](#one-design-for-every-window)); this stayed, because nothing else
runs an app without the launcher.

- **It exists because a module cannot run itself.** Each app's `main()`
  ends `if app.instance(): return tb else: return app.exec_()`, which is
  the [launcher contract](../CLAUDE.md#app-module-contract) - the launcher
  already owns a QApplication and its loop. But `app.instance()` is
  truthy the moment a QApplication exists, so a module run directly takes
  that same branch: it builds the flowgraph, shows the window, returns,
  and the window never gets an event loop. `_run.py` is the piece the
  launcher usually supplies. It also does the `XInitThreads()` each app's
  own `__main__` block does, since importing a module skips that block,
  and it restores and saves the window's place and controls as the
  launcher does.
- **`timeout`, `kill` and Ctrl+C stop it - since 2026-09-19.** Before
  then an app run here ignored `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT`. On TVAdemo the FM
  video transmitter was still on the air five minutes after `SIGTERM`, on
  419% of a core across 53 threads, its main thread parked in Qt's poll,
  and the NTSC transmitter did the same; only `SIGKILL` ended either.
  **A plain `timeout` sends `SIGTERM`**, so the timeout every command on
  TVAdemo gets ([machines](machines.md#the-tvademo-laptop-and-why-there-is-a-second-machine))
  did not end the run at all: the transmitter stayed on the air, and
  `timeout` itself waited on it for good. Only `timeout -k`, which follows
  up with `SIGKILL`, ended it.
- **Why it ignored them: nothing Python ran on the main thread.** Python
  runs a signal's handler only when the main thread next runs Python,
  and under `exec_()` the main thread sits in Qt's C++ event loop. Each
  app's `main()` starts a 500 ms timer to give Python the thread, but
  holds it in a local, so it is collected as `main()` returns. An app
  with Python timers of its own never showed the fault - the FM + RDS
  transmitter stopped on time with the old `_run.py` - and since
  2026-09-18 `ClickToMove`'s Python event filter has hidden it in every
  app. Swapping that filter for a C++ one brought it straight back: the
  AM Sine Generator and the FM video transmitter, on a stand-in radio,
  ignored `SIGTERM` exactly as on TVAdemo. This note once ruled the
  collected timer out, on a stripped-down reproduction that took
  `SIGTERM` at once; this one says otherwise.
- **So `_run.py` makes sure of it, the same way for every app.** It
  installs its own handler for both signals - stop the flowgraph, wait,
  quit, as the apps' own does - and keeps its own timer ticking every
  200 ms for the life of the loop. The ATSC and NTSC receivers install no
  handler at all, so `SIGTERM` used to kill them outright, with no clean
  stop, and Ctrl+C did nothing; they now stop like the rest. The handler
  first sets an alarm: if the stop is stuck - a radio block that never
  returns from `work()` - `SIGALRM`'s default action ends the process
  5 s later, which needs no Python to run. Windows has no alarm, so a
  thread does it there. A signal stops the app without saving its
  window's place or controls, as closing the window would.
- **Measured, 2026-09-19.** All sixteen apps on a stand-in radio, with
  `ClickToMove` swapped out, exit 0.1-0.3 s after `SIGTERM`, and the ATSC
  and NTSC receivers the same after `SIGINT`; a stop made to hang ends at
  5.2 s. The RDS and ATSC receivers on a real BB60D exit 0.3 s after
  either signal. And on the air: the AM Sine Generator on a VSG60, at
  102.1 MHz and 81%, under a plain `timeout 20`, with a BB60D on another
  laptop across the bench logging the carrier's power ten times a second
  (the two clocks matched to a few tenths of a second):

  | `_run.py` | carrier last heard | process gone |
  |---|---|---|
  | before the fix, `ClickToMove` swapped out | +29.8 s: `SIGTERM` at +20 s ignored, ended by `-k 10`'s `SIGKILL` | +30.0 s |
  | fixed, `ClickToMove` swapped out | +20.0 s | +20.3 s |
  | fixed, as shipped | +19.8 s | +20.2 s |

  The FM + RDS transmitter, fixed, went quiet within 0.15 s of the
  timeout both ways. On Windows, which has no `SIGTERM` to send from
  outside - `Stop-Process` ends a process outright - it has not been
  tried.
- **Give `timeout` a `-k` on a bench machine all the same.** The fix
  depends on the handler getting to run, and `-k 5` ends anything that
  does not stop for any reason. A killed transmitter leaves
  `config/.vsg60.lock` behind, which is only harmless because the lock is
  keyed by a PID and a dead one is treated as stale.
- **It has run a real app against a real radio**: the FM video
  transmitter on TVAdemo's VSG60, from a `--config` file, headless, and
  it transmitted correctly. `scripts/test_app_close.py` used to fail on
  `_run.py`, which lives in `apps/` and has a `main()` of its own; it
  skips names beginning with an underscore now, since a leading
  underscore there means a helper rather than an app.

## One design for every window

The launcher, the config dialogs and the flowgraph windows are meant to
look like one program. The palette, the type scale and the faces live in
**`apps/theme.py`** and every window reads them - `apply_launcher_theme`,
`apply_dark_theme` and `apply_flowgraph_theme` take Qt style sheets from
it. Edit a colour there and all of them move.

**The design was first drawn as a browser page**, a second front end onto
the same grid and settings, served by `web/server.py`, while the launcher
kept the grey stylesheet it had always had. The launcher was then given
the page's look, which a Qt stylesheet does most of, with Python painting
the rest - which is why the CSS each piece stands in for is named below.
Once the launcher carried the whole design, the page was no longer
needed, and it was removed on 2026-09-19 with its server,
`scripts/probe_radio.py` and `/theme.css`, which `apps/theme.py` used to
generate for it. Its one feature the launcher lacks is a list of running
apps with a Stop button - and Stop could not stop one then (see [running
one app without the launcher](#running-one-app-without-the-launcher)).

`apps/theme.py` **imports nothing but the standard library at module
level**, so its test needs no Qt; `load_fonts` imports Qt inside itself.

```sh
python scripts/test_theme.py    # no radio, no display, no GNU Radio
```

checks every theme's colours (see [testing them](#testing-them)), that no
Qt stylesheet has an unsubstituted token, that every theme's faces and
their licences are in `fonts/`, and that every row of tiles has a heading.

**A Qt stylesheet looks like CSS but is not, and four of the things the
design needs have no QSS equivalent at all.** They are done to the pixels
instead, in `RFbenchToolkit.py`:

| CSS would say | Qt has no such thing, so |
|---|---|
| `--ground` and the rest of `:root` | Python formats the tokens into the sheet, the way `icon_url()` already got absolute paths into a `url()` |
| `object-fit: cover` with `filter: saturate(.82)` | `cover_crop()` crops each icon to 4:3 about its middle, once, with PIL, and `picture_pixmap()` pulls the colour back with numpy - and brings it back under the pointer, as a `:hover` would |
| `letter-spacing` on the TRANSMIT/RECEIVE line | `token_font()`, because only a QFont has it |
| `::after`, the hairline running off a bank's heading | a `PulseLine` in the row, which paints itself - Qt's `::` are sub-controls of a known widget, not pseudo-elements anyone can invent |

A fifth, `opacity` on a tile the radio cannot run, was already solved: the
picture is dimmed by the painter in `_draw` and the caption by the
stylesheet's own `:disabled` colours, because the two caption labels carry
an opacity effect each for the flip and effects do not nest predictably.

Drop shadows, a tile's lift under the pointer and the pulse along each
line came later, and have no QSS equivalent either - see [the
themes](#the-themes-and-the-disc-that-picks-one).

**The grid wraps now**, which is CSS's
`repeat(auto-fill, minmax(150px, 1fr))` done by hand in `_relayout` -
a stylesheet does no layout at all. Tiles are at least 150 px wide, as
many to a row as fit, inside a column capped at 1080 and centred in the
window, as CSS's `max-width: 1080px; margin: 0 auto` would, for both
the rail's contents and the body (`centred_column`). Without the centring
a maximised launcher kept its tiles in the leftmost 1080 px while the
rail and the bank hairlines ran on across the whole screen.

**It never makes more columns than the widest bank has tiles**, which is
five. A sixth column could only ever be empty, and it arrived right at
the default width: 980 px of window gave five tiles of 181, 1000 gave six
of 153 - three pixels off the minimum, the sixth slot holding nothing in
any bank. Capped, a wider window widens the five instead, until the
column reaches 1080 and they stop at 208. Measured: four columns below
about 840 px of window, five from there to a full 1920, and at the
launcher's own size five of 185 with nothing to scroll. The cap is read off
`APP_TILES` rather than written down as 5, so a bank that gains a sixth
tile gets a sixth column. Two more things worth knowing:

- **Watch the scroll area's viewport, not the window.** The viewport
  changes width without the window being resized - the scroll bar
  appearing is enough - so a `resizeEvent` on the window alone left the
  grid laid out for whatever width it had before it was first shown: six
  columns of room, three columns of tiles, measured. It is an event filter
  on `viewport()` instead.
- **`scripts/test_launcher_gui.py` finds tiles as bright blobs**, and a
  wrapped bank puts one row of tiles on two rows of blobs, after which
  every click lands on the wrong tile. It compares the blob rows against
  `APP_TILES` now and says the window is too narrow, rather than failing
  several steps later like a broken button. The size window it accepts
  also had to come down: a picture is 4:3 rather than a 200 px square, and
  as short as 111 px at the width where a fifth column has only just
  fitted.

Two smaller traps, both found by looking at a screenshot:

- **A child widget paints its own background over its parent's border.**
  The rail's `border-bottom` came out interrupted under the wordmark, and
  would have vanished under the centred column its contents now sit in,
  so everything inside `#rail` is transparent.
- **A QFont sizes in points and a stylesheet in pixels.** A font built the
  obvious way from a token meant for QSS comes out about a third too big
  on a 96 dpi screen; `token_font()` calls `setPixelSize`.
- **A layout does not know a stylesheet drew a border.** The tile's layout
  began at the button's edge, so its picture sat on the 1 px border at the
  top and left and left a strip of panel before the one on the right. The
  layout is inset by 1 px all round.

Three more, all found making the launcher measure its own height before
it is shown - each one made it come out at its 600 px minimum:

- **A QPushButton ignores the layout it holds.** It sizes itself from its
  own text and icon, and a tile has neither, so its size hint was a small
  empty button. On screen that never showed, because showing a window
  activates each layout and pushes the real size on as a minimum - too
  late to measure from. `FlipTile.sizeHint` returns its layout's.
- **Qt invalidates a layout by posting an event.** Before the event loop
  has run, the outer widget answers from its cache: 143x196 for a page
  really 997x766. `natural_size` asks the column's own layout.
- **A stylesheet's type sizes arrive when a widget is polished**, which is
  otherwise on first show; `ensurePolished()` first, or every label is
  measured in the default font.

The launcher also gained a **header rail** - wordmark, the radio Settings
has chosen, and the gear - and a **scroll area**, which it badly needed:
the old grid had none, so on a 768-high laptop the video row sat below the
bottom edge with no way to reach it. The gear is an SVG of three
faders, rendered through QtSvg, which retired twenty lines of PIL
that brightened a photograph of a cog and keyed its background out.

The launcher keeps **no list of running apps**, which the browser page
had. In single mode it hides itself while an app runs, so there would be
nothing to show it to.

### The flowgraph windows wear it too

The windows an app opens once OK is pressed were the last thing still in
Qt's light grey, with GNU Radio's white plots and black and blue traces.
They now take the same design: the window on the ground, each group of
controls or readout a panel card, each plot a well with a rule round it,
the first trace in `trace` and the second (Imag) in `ink_3`. Every control and
every plot is the app's own - it is paint only, `theme.flowgraph_qss()`,
which shares its buttons, inputs, sliders and ticks with the dialogs'
(`_CONTROLS_QSS`), so a dialog and the window it opens read as one app.

Each app's `__init__` calls **`apply_flowgraph_theme(self)`** first thing,
where GRC put `qtgui.util.check_set_qss()` (which applied a GNU Radio
theme from the user's GNU Radio preferences, and is gone). First thing
matters, twice:

- **The plots' axis titles keep the application font they were built
  with.** GNU Radio sets their size as a font of their own, copied from the
  application's at that moment, and nothing in PyQt can reach a Qwt title
  afterwards. Themed after the plots were built, the titles stayed in Noto
  Sans with Barlow all round them. So the application font becomes Barlow
  before any plot exists.
- **A stylesheet's properties go on when a widget is polished**, which is
  when it is shown - after the app's own `set_line_color` calls. That is
  how the traces are recoloured without touching any app's colour lists:
  the plots expose `line_color1`-`9`, `palette_color` (the canvas),
  `zoomer_color` and the frequency plot's markers as Qt properties, and
  the sheet sets them.

Three things worth knowing before changing it:

- **No `font-family` or `font-size` on `QWidget` or `QLabel`**, unlike the
  dialog's sheet. A stylesheet font beats `setFont()`, and the receivers
  set fonts that mean something: the RadioText and the program list in
  monospace, so a gap or a stray character shows where it is, and the lock
  status large. The face comes from the application font instead, which a
  widget's own `setFont()` still overrides.
- **`qproperty-marker_peak_amplitude_color` segfaults GNU Radio 3.10.12's
  frequency plot**, with no Python frame at all - found by bisecting the
  sheet one property at a time on a lone `freq_sink_c`. Every other
  property it sets is safe on every plot kind the apps use.
- **The receivers' status colours are tokens now** - `good`, `warn` and
  `bad`, added to `TOKENS`. The old green and red were
  picked for Qt's light grey and read 3.2:1 and 3.0:1 on the new panel;
  the tokens read 8.5, 8.2 and 5.6:1 there - and 1.6-2.4:1 on the old
  grey, so the colours and the panel only work together.

```sh
python scripts/test_flowgraph_windows.py                 # all 16, twice, ~80 s
python scripts/test_flowgraph_windows.py --save /tmp/shots
```

builds every app's real window the way `launch_application` does, with a
stand-in radio (a throttle into nothing for a transmitter, noise and a tone
for a receiver) and no sound card, so it needs no radio and runs beside a
launcher. It renders the whole scroll content, fold and all, and checks
that the window carries the sheet, that little outside the plots is near
white, that the well shows on every canvas, that each trace in use has
3:1 against it, that every label has 4.5:1 against what is behind it, and
that the axes are in Barlow. Run with the theme switched off, every one
of the sixteen fails, on 6 to 13 counts each, so a passing run means
something. No
window is ever closed, because an app's `closeEvent` writes into the
user's own `QSettings`.

It then builds all sixteen again with **no media folder**, which is how a
machine starts before Settings has been opened, and only requires each
to build and run. The dialog greys out OK there, but `apps/_run.py
--config` goes straight to `main()`, and the FM Subcarrier Generator
handed no file died on `None` where the other audio apps play silence.
The first pass caught that only because it ran on a new machine; the
second pass fails on it on any machine.

**The stylesheet made the sliders follow the mouse, and the fix lives
beside it.** A Qt stylesheet with hover rules turns on mouse tracking, so
a slider hears every movement of the pointer across it, button or not:
off with no stylesheet, on with this one, measured. GNU Radio's
`RangeWidget` slider has its own `mouseMoveEvent`, which jumps to wherever
the pointer is without asking whether a button is down. So once the
windows were themed, passing the mouse over a power slider set the
power, from 50 % to 89 % on the way across, on every window with one:
AM Sine, ASK, FSK and PSK, the NTSC, ATSC and FM video transmitters,
and the rest. The user found it on 2026-09-18. The scroll wheel did the same by
another route: most windows scroll on the laptop, and a scroll that
passed over a slider, spin box or combo box moved that instead, and a
spin box took focus from the wheel alone.

`ClickToMove` in `apps/utils.py`, which `apply_flowgraph_theme` installs,
takes on every slider, spin box and combo box when the window is first
shown:

- a mouse move with no button down is dropped;
- a wheel turn over one that has not been clicked is passed on to the
  scroll area;
- the wheel no longer gives focus.

Clicking gives focus, and dragging, typing and the wheel then work as
before. The scroll bars are left out: scrolling is what the wheel is
for. `test_flowgraph_windows.py` sends every control a buttonless move
and a wheel turn each way, requires it to stay put, and requires a press
and drag to still move a slider. With the guard switched off it fails
on all of them, the power slider included. It sends the events to the
controls directly. On a real display, and a real scroll reaching the
scroll area, it has not been tried.

### The themes, and the disc that picks one

There are three themes, all from the same tokens: **Slate**, the dark
blue-black the app has always had and still the default; **Reading
Room**, the light one, paper and iron-gall ink, from voice-summary; and
**Walnut**, brown with tan for its highlights, like a wooden radio's
cabinet and the tan face of its dial. The way of choosing is
voice-summary's too: the word "Themes" and a disc in the header, between
the radio tag and the gear. The disc *is* the theme in
force, and a click moves on to the next. Its tooltip is the theme's name
alone - "Walnut", not "Theme: Walnut", since pointing at the disc already
says it is the theme. The accessible name keeps the word, and says which
theme a click goes to, for a screen reader that has no pointer to give it
that.

**The third theme took four tries, and what failed is worth knowing.**
All were built and shown on 2026-09-18. voice-summary's Tape Room, a
near-black brown with amber and red for highlights, was found flat. Neon,
violet with the tile pictures drawn through a magenta-to-cyan waterfall
colour ramp, was found awful. 8-Bit, an NES role-playing game's menu with
pixel fonts and pixel-art pictures, was not liked either. The user then
asked for brown with tan highlights, which is Walnut: lighter, warmer
browns than Tape Room's, and one accent instead of three. Themes that
restyled the pictures did not survive, so don't offer another theme
without being asked.

#### What a theme is

- **A palette, and optionally faces of its own.** `THEMES` in
  `apps/theme.py` holds one palette per theme, and a theme's `type` names
  faces of its own. The sizes, the radii and every rule are shared, so no
  theme can move a control. The launcher measures its own size from
  whichever faces are in force, and lays its grid out afresh after a
  theme change, because the captions' height depends on the face.
- **Things beyond colour are `EXTRAS`**: `shadow`, `shadow_hover` and
  `lift` for the tiles, `pulse` for the bank lines, and `ok_invert` for
  Reading Room's OK button - all below. A theme without one draws none.
- **`TOKENS` is the theme in force, and `use()` changes it in place.** So
  `from apps.theme import TOKENS` still works, but only for a colour read
  at the moment it is needed. The three video receivers copied their lock
  colours into class attributes when the module was imported, which would
  have kept whatever theme was in force then. They now take them in
  `__init__`, straight after `apply_flowgraph_theme`.
- **The choice is `theme` in `window_settings.json`**, not a browser's
  storage, which is where voice-summary keeps it. Here the dialogs and
  the flowgraph windows have to read it too, including one started by
  `apps/_run.py`, which runs as a process of its own. Every
  `apply_*_theme` calls `use_saved_theme()` first. A window that is
  already open keeps the theme it was painted in; the launcher repaints
  straight away.

#### Each theme's type

- **Each theme has a voice of its own.** Slate is the modern sans,
  Barlow. Reading Room has voice-summary's own faces for it, a modern
  library: Archivo, a grotesque, for the wordmark, the TRANSMIT line and
  the headings, and Source Serif 4 for the rest, in its SmText cut, the
  one drawn for small sizes. A "modern" Reading Room was the first idea,
  and was dropped because Slate already is one. Walnut is the antique:
  Limelight, 1930s Art Deco, the lettering of a radio's nameplate, for
  the wordmark, the TRANSMIT line and the headings, and Libre Caslon Text,
  a Caslon drawn for screens, for everything read at length. Fanwood and
  IM Fell looked older still, but their old-style figures drop below the
  line, and this app is mostly frequencies.
- **No face may be given a fake bold.** A face with no bold of its own is
  thickened when one is asked for, which fills in Limelight's hairlines
  and turns Archivo SemiBold into a smudge. So every face is a static
  file, one weight to a file, because Qt 5 cannot choose a weight from a
  variable one. The two text faces run to a real Bold, because the
  receivers set their status line and their captions bold in whatever the
  application font is. The trap is not obvious: **Qt 5 reads a
  stylesheet's `font-weight` divided by 8**, so the `600` the wordmark,
  the TRANSMIT line and plot titles asked for is Qt's 75, Bold. Barlow has
  a real Bold, so Slate never showed it. Limelight and Archivo SemiBold do
  not, and FreeType thickened them - a third more ink on each, found by
  measuring the ink rather than by eye. Those rules now ask for
  `qss_bold`, a type token: 600 in Slate, as it always was, and 500 - Qt's
  62, which matches the semibold, or Limelight's one weight, as drawn - in
  the two themes whose faces stop short of bold.

#### Each theme's colours

- **Walnut's tan reads as trim, not as another brown.** Its tan is its
  `ink_2`, `ink_3`, `rule` and `trace`, and its `ink_3` and `rule` sit
  well above Slate's - 6:1 and 3:1 on a panel, against 3:1 and 1.4:1. Its
  first tans, 4.5:1 and 2:1, were found too close to the walnut. The rule
  stops at 3:1 because selected text sits on it, and cream on it is
  already only 4.2:1.
- **A tile's TRANSMIT or RECEIVE line has a colour of its own, `tag`.**
  It is supplementary to the app's name, and in Walnut it was not acting
  so: in `ink_3`'s bright tan, 6:1 on a panel, and Limelight's heavy
  Deco, it caught the eye before the name did. Dimming `ink_3` would
  have dimmed the tile outlines, the slider fill and the hover border
  with it, so the line took a token of its own. In Walnut it is 3.5:1,
  near Slate's, against the name's 12.6:1. Slate and Reading Room have
  `tag` equal to `ink_3`.
- **A bank's name has one too, `heading`.** Reading Room's is full ink:
  in `ink_2` the names were too faint to head anything on paper. Slate's
  and Walnut's are their `ink_2`.
- **Four things had a colour of their own, and each one broke on paper.**
  Two hovers went to `#ffffff`, which put white behind white text on
  Reading Room's OK button; they use `ink_0` now, the step beyond `ink`.
  The settings dialog's radio list still carried the grey from before
  there was a theme, and opened as a dark box in a light dialog; that
  styling is gone. And the spin arrows and the tick are pictures (see
  [how every dialog gets laid out](#how-every-dialog-gets-laid-out)), and
  a picture's colour is baked in. `themed_icon_url` keeps each picture's
  shape, recolours it, and writes it once to a folder in the temp
  directory. The file name includes the colour, so a palette edited later
  gets a new file rather than a stale one.
- **Reading Room's OK inverts under the pointer** (`ok_invert`). Its
  `ink_0`, the step beyond ink, is a darker near-black on a near-black
  button, and the user found the hover all but invisible. So OK takes the
  look of the plain button beside it, Cancel's light panel and dark text,
  and pressed goes back to black. The dark themes keep the step brighter.
  `ok_hover()` in `apps/theme.py` gives OK's hover colours for either kind
  of theme, and the stylesheets take them from it. A turn to the pulse's
  blue came first, and gave way to this. OK also shows when it is pressed
  now, in every theme: `QPushButton:pressed` lost to `:default` at equal
  specificity, so a click gave no sign. `:default:pressed` puts it back at
  rest.

#### Shadows, and the tile under the pointer

- **Every theme's tiles have drop shadows and lift under the pointer.**
  They were made for Reading Room and then asked for in the other two.
  `shadow` is a tile's shadow as (drop, blur, opacity) layers, a contact
  shadow close under it and a softer one further out, drawn in `shade`,
  a colour of its own - the ink on paper, black in Slate, a near-black
  brown in Walnut. Not the ink: in a dark theme that is near white. On a
  near-black ground a shadow has to be two to three times as dark to be
  seen at all, so the dark themes' layers are.
- **Under the pointer a tile lifts**: it rises `lift`, 3 px, and its
  shadow changes to `shadow_hover`, over 150 ms and back. On paper that
  is the same two layers dropped further, spread wider and darker. The
  first try had no rise and a fainter shadow, and was found too faint. A
  dimmed tile does not lift.
- **In the dark a lifted card is lit, not shadowed.** A layer may name
  its own colour as a fourth item. Slate's and Walnut's `shadow_hover`
  keep a dark contact shadow close under the card and add a halo of the
  trace's colour with no drop - pale ice, and tan lamplight. The user
  asked whether the shadow should be white. A light dropped below the
  card reads as a glow leaking from underneath; a halo all round it reads
  as the card lighting up.
- **The launcher paints the shadows from the column the tiles sit in**
  (`ShadowColumn`), not with a `QGraphicsDropShadowEffect` on each tile:
  a tile's two caption labels already carry an opacity effect each, for
  the flip, and effects do not nest predictably. `shadow_pixmap` blurs
  each layer with PIL - a CSS blur of B is a Gaussian of B/2 - and
  composites them in their own colours, premultiplied, first on top, as a
  `box-shadow` list does, once per tile size. A shadow reaches past its
  tile, so the column repaints whole whenever the grid is laid out, or a
  moved tile would leave shadow behind. The launcher animates a `lift`
  property on the tile, 0 to 1; the column cross-fades the two shadows by
  it, and the tile is moved up by hand off the place the grid gave it.
  `settle()` puts it back whenever the grid is laid out again, and
  `moveEvent` takes any move the tile did not make as the grid placing
  it, and rises from there - otherwise a layout pass mid-lift sent the
  tile back to a place that no longer existed when the pointer left.
- **The grid decides its tile width from the window, never from the
  scroll bar.** Walnut's Caslon captions made its page 3 px taller than a
  window sized for Slate. The scroll bar came, the tiles narrowed from 185
  to 183, a caption rewrapped, the page fit, the bar went - and the grid
  flipped between the two for as long as the window stayed that size,
  which also cancelled a lifted tile's lift. `_relayout` now lays the grid
  out as though there were no bar. If the page then comes out taller than
  the viewport, it lays out for the width the bar leaves, at once. The
  answer depends only on the window's size, so it settles. A change of
  theme lays the grid out twice, the second time once the event loop has
  run: a stylesheet's fonts reach the labels by posted events, so
  measured at once the page still had the previous theme's type, and Slate
  after Walnut settled at 183 px with 10 px to spare.

#### The pulse down each bank's line

- **The heading charges, then fires the pulse down its line.** For 1.2 s
  the name takes on the pulse's colour and a glow gathers round it,
  faster as it goes. Then the pulse - a 160 px head and tail - leaves the
  end of the name and crosses the line in 1.6 s, while the name's glow
  dies away in 0.35 s. Each row goes 0.5 s after the one above, so the
  signal runs down the page as well as along it, every 4.5 s. `pulse` is
  its colour: ultramarine on paper - it was the trace's teal until the
  user asked for blue - pale ice in Slate and tan in Walnut. The first
  charge was 0.7 s and dimmer, and was asked to be longer and brighter.
- **The text takes the colour, because a glow alone did not show.** Dark
  text in a faint teal halo on paper barely read as charging. The glow is
  the effect's blur plus a faint stroke of the pulse's colour round the
  letters, because the effect only blurs the shape it is given and thin
  text gives it little. At 2.4 px and 55% the stroke made the letters look
  bold and smudged; it is 1.6 px at 30%.
- **The line is a `PulseLine`, painted, where it was a `QFrame`, and the
  name a `ChargeLabel`.** The line is three pixels tall, the one-pixel
  line in the middle and room for the pulse's glow either side. The name
  paints its own text in a colour mixed by its `charge`, and its glow is a
  `QGraphicsDropShadowEffect` with no offset. One timer moves every line
  and name at 30 frames a second, timed from `theme.PULSE`, and it runs
  only while the launcher is showing and the theme has a pulse. It stops
  in `hideEvent`, so in single mode, where the launcher hides while an app
  runs, it costs the app nothing.

#### The disc

- **The disc shows the ground and the trace, not `live`.** The trace is
  the colour that differs most from one theme to the next: pale ice,
  teal ink and tan. The launcher draws the disc from the tokens.
  voice-summary writes each disc's colours out separately, and nothing
  there notices when a disc stops matching its theme.
- **Its focus ring appears only when Tab brought the focus.** The disc is
  the first thing in the launcher that takes focus, so Qt hands it focus
  as the window opens. A ring drawn on any focus would have sat there from
  the start.

`test_theme.py` holds every palette to the contrast Slate's colours give:
labels 4.5:1 on the ground, panel and well, the status colours 4.5:1 (they
are the receivers' lock line), a bank's name 4.5:1, a tile's TRANSMIT line
3:1, the trace 3:1 on the well, and the OK button's text at rest, under
the pointer and in `ink_0`. Given Reading Room's first `ink_3` it failed
at 2.76:1 on the ground, and the colour was darkened. It also checks every
theme's faces ship in `fonts/` with their licences. Both window tests set
the theme themselves, Slate unless `--theme` says otherwise, so the user's
own choice cannot change what they test. On a light theme the window test
checks for near black rather than near white.
`scripts/test_launcher_gui.py` sets the theme to Slate for its run and
puts the user's back afterwards, the same way it handles `tile_faces`: it
finds the tiles as bright pictures on a dark window, and on Reading Room's
paper the whole window is bright. **Hover in an offscreen test needs a
real pointer** - `QTest.mouseMove` on the window's handle. Setting
`WA_UnderMouse`, or drawing with `State_MouseOver` in the style option,
leaves a stylesheet `:hover` unapplied. All sixteen windows pass in all
three themes, and so do the dialogs, on the offscreen platform. The user
has since been using all three on a real display and found them good
(2026-09-19). On Windows they are unconfirmed.

**The title bar follows the theme on Windows only.** `match_title_bar` in
`apps/utils.py` sets DWM's dark mode on each window: dark for Slate and
Walnut, light for Reading Room. On Windows 11 it also sets the caption,
its text and the border to the theme's ground, ink and rule, so the
launcher's title bar runs on into its rail. It has not been tried: the
laptop runs anything started over SSH in session 0, where no window can
be seen. On Linux it does nothing, because nothing works there. GNOME 46
(Ubuntu 24.04, on both Linux machines here) draws X11 title bars with
`mutter-x11-frames`. That program listens only to the desktop's own
`color-scheme` setting and reads no hint from the window. Measured on
2026-09-18: `_GTK_THEME_VARIANT=dark`, which older GNOME honoured, left
the bar at #e8e8e8 whether it was set while the window was up or before
it was mapped. A dark title bar on Linux would take either the desktop
switched to dark, which changes every app's title bar, or a frameless
window drawing a title bar of its own.

## The typefaces

`fonts/` holds Barlow and Barlow Semi Condensed as six static TTFs, beside
the SIL OFL they are licensed under. They are *vendored* rather than
installed, for the same reason `vendor/libvsg_api.so.1` is: Google Fonts is
only where Barlow happens to ship.

Reading Room's Archivo (SemiBold) and Source Serif 4 SmText (Regular,
Semibold and Bold), and Walnut's Limelight and Libre Caslon Text (Regular,
SemiBold and Bold), sit beside them, each with its own licence:
`OFL-Archivo.txt`, `OFL-SourceSerif.txt`, `OFL-Limelight.txt` and
`OFL-LibreCaslon.txt`. `LICENCES` in `apps/theme.py` says which is whose,
and `test_theme.py` checks each is there. The static Archivo and Libre
Caslon are from their own projects, and the static Source Serif is Adobe's
own build: Google Fonts ships all three only as variable files, and Qt 5
cannot choose a weight from a variable file. Adobe's and Limelight's
licences reserve their names, 'Source' and 'Limelight'. That binds only a
modified copy, so every file is shipped exactly as it came.

- **There is no apt package.** `fonts-barlow` is not in the Ubuntu archive
  at all, and an apt install would only ever fix one of the three machines
  anyway - the Windows laptop has no apt, and TVAdemo has no git and is kept
  in step by copying files. A system font install is a per-machine step that
  nothing checks, and a missing face does not raise: the app renders in
  something else, which is the kind of wrongness only ever found by looking
  at the screen.
- **Nothing reaches the network at run time.** The two URLs in
  `windows/bootstrap.ps1` are for installing Windows from scratch.
- **Qt loads them with `QFontDatabase.addApplicationFont`**, so the desktop
  side needs no system install either and both platforms render the same.
- **Qt clamps to the heaviest face shipped rather than synthesising one.**
  Asking for weight 700 in Barlow measures exactly what 600 does, because
  SemiBold is the heaviest of the three cut here; a synthesiser would have
  smeared it wider. So asking for a weight the set does not carry is not an
  error and does not look like one - it is silently the nearest that is
  there.
- **The whole directory travels together.** The OFL requires the licence
  alongside the fonts wherever they are passed on, which is the same rule
  `media/VIDEO-CREDITS.txt` follows for the CC BY clips: copying `fonts/` to
  TVAdemo means copying `OFL.txt` with it.
