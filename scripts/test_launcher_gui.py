"""Drive the launcher through a real X session: click an app, run it, close it.

The other test scripts exercise the signal chain with no GUI at all. This one
covers the part they cannot: that ``./start_app.sh`` starts, that a button
press reaches ``launch_application``, that the config dialog accepts, that the
flowgraph window actually appears, and that closing it brings the launcher
back. Everything is driven with real X input through xdotool, so the app is
exercised exactly as a person would.

    python scripts/test_launcher_gui.py "FM + RDS Transmitter" --hold 30
    python scripts/test_launcher_gui.py "ATSC Video Receiver"

An app on the back of a flip tile - the RDS receiver, the ATSC receiver -
is reached by asking for it by name like any other: the tile is turned over
before the launcher starts, through the same saved setting the badge
writes, and turned back afterwards. Clicking the badge in pixels would test
the animation rather than the app, and would mean finding a 32-pixel circle
in a screenshot.

WARNING: the transmitter really transmits. Point it at an empty channel.

Needs xdotool (``apt install xdotool``) and a display.
