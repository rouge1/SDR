"""Drive RdsProtocol through a RadioText change of the kind 98.7 WMZQ makes.

The station rotates a slogan, the song and an advert through RadioText and
never toggles the A/B flag that is meant to announce a new message. Groups are
fed straight to the protocol layer here, so this tests the text handling rather
than the demodulator - no radio, no capture.

The last sections are the exception: whole bitstreams from the transmitter's
encoder, first with error bursts in them to show the display holds steady on a
marginal signal, then clean, to show a typed message taking turns with the song.
