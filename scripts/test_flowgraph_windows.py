"""Open every flowgraph window with no radio, and check it wears the theme.

    python scripts/test_flowgraph_windows.py                 # every app
    python scripts/test_flowgraph_windows.py amSineGenerator
    python scripts/test_flowgraph_windows.py --save /tmp/shots
    python scripts/test_flowgraph_windows.py --theme reading-room

The config dialogs have ``scripts/test_dialog_layout.py``; this is the same
for the windows that come up once OK is pressed. Each app is built the way
``launch_application`` builds it - its own ``ConfigDialog`` for the values
it would open with, then its real ``main()`` - with the radio swapped for a
stand-in, so the whole signal chain runs and the plots have something to
draw. A transmitter's radio becomes a throttle into nothing, at the rate
the app asked for; a receiver's becomes noise with a tone in it; a sound
card becomes nothing at all. Nothing opens a device, so it runs beside a
launcher, and with any radio plugged in.

What it checks, on the window as rendered:

- **It carries the flowgraph theme** (``apply_flowgraph_theme``), and
  almost nothing on it is still the light grey and white it used to be -
  or, on a light theme, near black, which is what something still
  painting a dark theme of its own shows as. Slate unless ``--theme``
  says otherwise, whatever the user has chosen: the settings the apps
  read are patched, as below.
- **Every plot's canvas is the well**, as the browser page draws its plots.
- **Every trace can be seen against it.** The apps set their traces in
  GNU Radio's colours for a white canvas, and black is the commonest - on
  the well it would be invisible. Each line in use needs 3:1 against the
  canvas, the WCAG figure for a graphic that has to be made out.
- **Every label can be read**: 4.5:1 against what is behind it, including
  the receivers' own status colours.
- **Nothing in the window moves until it has been clicked.** A pointer
  passing over a slider, or a scroll wheel turning over any control, used
  to set it - see ``ClickToMove`` in ``apps/utils.py``. Dragging still
  has to work.
- **The power and frequency set in the window are what the dialog opens
  on next time** - gain, on a receiver, and deviation on FM video. The window's own controls are set
  as a user would set them, to their finest digit, and saved as the
  launchers save them on close: only what changed may be written, and a
  fresh dialog must read it back exactly. Its OK must then keep the
  window's position, which lives in the same file. Into a throwaway
  folder, never the real ``config/``.

Then every app again with no media folder, which is how a machine starts
before Settings has been opened: each must still build its flowgraph and
run. Its dialog greys out OK there, but the browser launcher's
``apps/_run.py --config`` goes straight to ``main()``, and a transmitter
handed no file once died on ``None`` - found only because this test ran on
a new machine. The windows are not looked at again; that is the first
pass's job.

Then, with no window from any app, that a window's position, size and
maximized flag go into the app's config and come back out of it - into a
throwaway folder, never the real ``config/``.

Each app runs in a process of its own, because ``main()`` installs signal
handlers and a flowgraph that goes wrong should take only itself down. None
of them is ever closed: an app's ``closeEvent`` writes its geometry into
the user's own ``QSettings``, and a test must not.
