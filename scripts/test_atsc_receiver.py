"""ATSC transmitter into ATSC receiver, no radio at all.

``test_atsc_loopback.py`` proves the transmit chain against GNU Radio's own
receiver. This proves *our* receiver - the one the app runs - and in
particular the thing that cost the most time getting ATSC on the air: a
transmitter whose clock is a few parts per million out puts the pilot a few
kilohertz from where A/53 says and stretches the symbol rate by the same
fraction, and correcting only the first leaves the decoder producing noise
from a signal whose spectrum looks perfect.

So the test deliberately breaks the transmitter's clock and requires the
receiver to put it back, carrier *and* symbol rate:

    python scripts/test_atsc_receiver.py <stream.ts>
    python scripts/test_atsc_receiver.py <stream.ts> --ppm 13.3

13.3 ppm is not an arbitrary number - it is what a HackRF measured on this
bench at 533 MHz.

The signal is rendered to temporary files first (about 190 MB per second of
signal, deleted afterwards) rather than generated into the receiver. That
costs disk but buys the measurement that matters most: with no transmit
chain sharing the machine, the decode speed printed for each run is the
receiver's own, and that is what says whether it can keep up with the air.
