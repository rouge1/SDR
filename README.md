# RF Bench Toolkit

A launcher for a suite of GNU Radio transmitters and receivers. Pick a tile, set
it up in its dialog, and the flowgraph runs on whichever radio is selected.

---

## Features

- Two front ends onto the same grid and the same settings: a desktop launcher,
  and a browser page that starts the same apps
- 16 apps: signal generators, AM and FM audio, FM broadcast with RDS, and ATSC,
  NTSC and FM video - transmitters and receivers, with the two ends of each
  standard sharing one tile
- Four radios: **HackRF One** (USB via SoapySDR), **Ettus USRP** (network via
  UHD), **Signal Hound VSG60** (transmit only) and **Signal Hound BB60D**
  (receive only). The grid arranges itself around whichever is selected
- Runs on Linux and Windows
- Needs no network connection - the fonts ship with the repository
- Remembers each app's settings, and where every window was left
- Single and multi-radio operation modes

---

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- Linux (X11 or Wayland display required), or Windows 10/11 - see
  [On Windows](#on-windows)
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
- Audio: **PipeWire** (ALSA audio source is not supported)

### Hardware (one of the following)

- **HackRF One** — connected via USB; SoapySDR HackRF driver must be available in the conda environment
- **Ettus USRP** — reachable over the network via UHD 4.x; IP address configured in the Settings dialog
- **Signal Hound VSG60** — transmit only, Linux only; connected via USB; requires the vendor `libvsg_api.so`, which is **not** included in this repository — see [Signal Hound VSG60 library](#signal-hound-vsg60-library) below. 30 MHz – 6 GHz, up to 50 MS/s, calibrated output from −120 to +10 dBm
- **Signal Hound BB60D** — receive only; connected via USB; needs Signal Hound's SoapySDR module — see [Signal Hound BB60D](#signal-hound-bb60d) below

---

## Installation

### 0. Install Miniconda (skip if already installed)

```sh
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Follow the prompts and accept the default install path (`~/miniconda3`). When asked to initialize conda, choose **yes**. Then reload your shell:

```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rouge1/SDR.git
cd SDR
```

### 2. Create the conda environment

The Linux environment, `linux/environment.yml`, contains a hardcoded `prefix` for the original machine. Override it with `--name` so it installs correctly on any system:

```sh
conda env create -f linux/environment.yml --name gnu
```

> If conda reports that the environment already exists:
> ```sh
> conda env update -f linux/environment.yml --name gnu --prune
> ```

### 3. Verify the environment

```sh
conda activate gnu
python -c "from gnuradio import gr; print(gr.version())"
```

Expected output: `3.10.12.0`

### On Windows

The same GNU Radio (3.10.12) runs natively on Windows - no WSL. From the
repository folder in PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\windows\bootstrap.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\windows\start_app.ps1
```

The first installs Miniforge if there is no conda, builds the `gnu`
environment from `windows/environment.yml` (the Linux one cannot solve on
Windows), and checks that GNU Radio, SoapySDR and PyQt5 import and that
`ffmpeg`, which the video transmitters need for clips, is there. It is
safe to re-run after an update. The second starts the launcher; launch it from
the Windows desktop, since a window started over SSH never appears. A HackRF
often needs no driver work - Windows binds WinUSB to it by itself - and if
SoapySDR finds no device, bind WinUSB with Zadig. The VSG60 is not supported on
Windows yet.

---

## Signal Hound VSG60 library

Only needed if you are using a VSG60, and only on Linux. The vendor library `libvsg_api.so.1` is
proprietary Signal Hound code with no redistribution grant, so it is **not
committed to this repository** and cannot be installed with pip or conda. You
supply it from your own licensed copy.

It is a single self-contained ~8 MB file. It links only against standard system
libraries (`libusb-1.0`, `libstdc++`, `libudev`) and requires nothing newer than
glibc 2.17, so one file is all you need — no Sceptre install on the target
machine.

```sh
# From a machine that has Sceptre installed locally:
./linux/setup_vsg.sh

# From an explicit path (a Signal Hound SDK download, a USB stick, ...):
./linux/setup_vsg.sh /path/to/libvsg_api.so.1

# Copied from another machine that has it:
./linux/setup_vsg.sh user@host
```

The script puts the library in `vendor/` (gitignored — do not commit it),
installs the udev rule below, and verifies that the library loads and whether a
VSG is detected.

**Where to get the library:** any Sceptre install has it at
`/opt/sceptre/lib/libvsg_api.so.1`, or download the standalone VSG60 SDK from
Signal Hound, which is the same library without the rest of the Sceptre payload.

**Doing it by hand instead.** Drop the file anywhere the loader looks —
`vendor/` in this checkout, `/usr/local/lib` (run `ldconfig` afterwards), or a
path of your choosing exported as `VSG_API_LIB` (the file itself or the
directory holding it). Then add the udev rule, or the API cannot claim the
device even though `lsusb` lists it:

```sh
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="2817", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"' \
  | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/sh_usb.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

Replug the VSG60 afterwards.

> **Do not copy the whole `/opt/sceptre/lib` directory.** The library's `RUNPATH`
> starts with `$ORIGIN`, so it would load Sceptre's bundled `libc`, `libstdc++`
> and `libudev` from alongside it instead of the system ones. Copy the single
> file.

---

## Signal Hound BB60D

Receive only. It is driven through SoapySDR, but needs Signal Hound's SoapySDR
module for it installed on the system: the apps look for
`libSignalHoundBB60.so` in `/usr/local/lib/SoapySDR/modules0.8` (or the
distribution's own SoapySDR module folder) and point the conda environment's
SoapySDR at it themselves. Nothing in this repository replaces that module.
The receive gain is one 0-100% slider; 60% - the attenuator open and no RF
gain - is the default and usually the best setting.

---

## Running the Application

On Linux:

```sh
./linux/start_app.sh
```

On Windows, from PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\windows\start_app.ps1
```

Or activate the environment manually first:

```sh
conda activate gnu
python RFbenchToolkit.py
```

> `linux/start_app.sh` assumes Miniconda is installed at `~/miniconda3`. If your installation is elsewhere (e.g., `/opt/miniconda3`), edit the `source` line in that script accordingly.

### From a browser

```sh
conda activate gnu
python web/server.py                 # http://127.0.0.1:8730
python web/server.py --host 0.0.0.0  # prints a URL with a token in it
```

The page shows the same grid and settings and starts the same apps. Each app's
window opens on the display the **server** runs on, not in the browser - so a
phone can be the control surface for a bench monitor. Anything wider than this
machine needs the token in the printed URL; every tile keys a transmitter.

---

## First-Run Configuration

On first launch, open the **Settings** dialog (gear icon, top-right) and configure:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Media Directory | Folder of WAV audio and video clips. Subfolders are searched too, and `.WAV` counts as well as `.wav`; any video `ffmpeg` can read works |
| Radio Hardware | **HackRF One (USB)**, **Ettus USRP (Network)**, **Signal Hound VSG60 (USB, transmit only)** or **Signal Hound BB60D (USB, receive only)**. With a one-way radio every tile turns to the side it can run and the rest are dimmed |
| Launcher Mode | **Single** — launcher hides while an app runs; **Multi** — launcher stays open (requires ≥ 2 USRP IPs) |
| SDR IP Addresses | USRP only — enter each USRP IP address and click Add |

The repository ships no audio or video, so a fresh clone has nothing to pick
until **Media Directory** points at a folder: the WAV lists are empty, the video
transmitters offer only their built-in colour bars, and every app still runs on
its tone or pattern. Any WAV and any video `ffmpeg` reads will do.

Settings are saved to `config/window_settings.json` (created automatically on first run).
Nothing in `config/` is committed - window positions, radio choice and the
media folder are per machine - so a pull never overwrites them.
The launcher opens at a size it works out for itself - the widest bank's tiles
in one row, every bank in view - centred on the screen, and after that comes
back wherever it was left - maximized, if it was left maximized.

## Configuration Details

- **Global settings** — `config/window_settings.json` (radio type, IP addresses, media directory, launcher mode, window geometry)
- **Per-app settings** — `config/<module_name>_config.json` (last-used parameter values, and where its dialog and window were left)
- Both files are created automatically and are excluded from version control

---

## Adding a New Application

1. Create `apps/<module_name>.py` implementing:
   - `ConfigDialog(QDialog)` — configuration UI; must implement `get_values()` returning a dict
   - `main(top_block_cls=..., options=None, app=None, config_values=None)` — creates and starts the GNU Radio flowgraph, returns the `top_block` instance
2. Add an icon to `icons/`
3. Add a row to `APP_TILES` near the top of `RFbenchToolkit.py` -
   `(row, column, [(label, module, icon, 'tx' or 'rx')])`. To give an existing
   app its other end, such as a receiver for a transmitter, add a second face
   to that tile's list instead of a new row. Both front ends read this table

Refer to `apps/amSineGenerator.py` as a reference implementation.

## Troubleshooting

**`conda env create` fails with prefix conflict**
Add `--name gnu` to override the hardcoded prefix in `linux/environment.yml`.

**App launches but no RF output (HackRF)**
Ensure the HackRF is connected before starting. Run `SoapySDRUtil --find` to confirm it is detected. The power slider is a 0–100% control mapped onto the HackRF's VGA range, so 100% is 47 dB of VGA gain.

**App launches but no RF output (USRP)**
Confirm the USRP IP is reachable (`ping <ip>`) and matches what is configured in Settings.

**Signal Hound VSG60: "VSG API library not found" / "Software Not Found"**
The vendor library is missing on this machine — the device itself is fine, and `lsusb | grep 2817` will still list it. The dialog names every directory searched and every path tried. See [Signal Hound VSG60 library](#signal-hound-vsg60-library); usually `./linux/setup_vsg.sh` is enough. Note the Sceptre install directory is named after its version, so it differs from machine to machine.

**Signal Hound VSG60 detected by `lsusb` but not by the launcher**
The udev rule is missing, so the API cannot claim the device. Install it as shown in [Signal Hound VSG60 library](#signal-hound-vsg60-library) and replug the unit.

**App launches but no RF output (Signal Hound VSG60)**
Confirm the unit is detected with `lsusb | grep 2817`. The power slider maps 0–100% onto −120 to +10 dBm, so 100% is the VSG's maximum calibrated output. Requested frequencies outside 30 MHz – 6 GHz are clamped to the nearest limit and the clamp is logged to the console.

**Signal Hound VSG60 crashes with an assertion**
The vendor library calls `abort()` rather than returning an error if the device is already open in another process, which kills the app and can leave the VSG wedged. Launching twice from this launcher is caught and refused with a dialog, but an external Signal Hound application holding the device cannot be detected. If it does happen: close the other user of the device, then reset it — unplug/replug, or issue a `USBDEVFS_RESET` ioctl on the node shown by `lsusb | grep 2817`.

**Audio apps produce no sound / error on launch**
ALSA audio source is not supported. The system must use PipeWire. Verify with `pactl info | grep "Server Name"`.

**Launcher window appears off-screen after moving between display configurations**
It should come back by itself: a saved position no screen reaches any more is
ignored and the window is centred instead. To reset the launcher's size and
position by hand, remove just the `window_position` entry from
`config/window_settings.json`. Do not delete the whole file for this - it also
holds the media folder, the radio and the USRP addresses, and they go with it.

**A file in the media folder does not appear in an app's list**
The list is built when the app's dialog opens, so close the dialog and open it
again. Hidden files are skipped - including the `._` copies macOS leaves beside
files it writes to a USB stick - and so are folders reached through a symbolic
link.
